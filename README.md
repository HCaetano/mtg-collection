# MTG Collection Helper

The gif is not the best due to it having its original size reduded to comply with GitHub's 10mb file size limit. For a more in-depth demo of the app, check [this recording](https://www.loom.com/share/f73c1c11ef4a48e39cb3f4618f9ecca9).

The application makes requests to the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) in order to search for cards that are displayed to the user who can add them to their collection. The goal is to create an application that will help me keep my Magic: The Gathering collection updated. By doing that, I'll not only practice skills I already own, but, more importantly, I'll keep learning more about both front and back-end development. 

So far, I've developed a simple RESTful back-end on Spring Boot which has the CRUD operations in place. Recently, I'm putting effort on making the front-end better. It's built with React and I've been refactoring it to transition from class components to functional components plus hooks.

Feedback is welcome. ;)
