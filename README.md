# mtg-collection

The goal of this project is to create an application that will help me keep my Magic: The Gathering collection updated. By doing that, I'll not only practice skills I already own, but, more importantly, I'll keep learning more about both front and back-end development. 

So far, I've developed a simple RESTful back-end on Spring Boot in which I have the CRUD operations in place. Recently, I'm putting effort on making the front-end better. It's built with React and I've been refactoring it to put to use knowledge I've acquired recently on the 12-month full-stack development course I'm taking. 

Feedback is welcome. ;)
