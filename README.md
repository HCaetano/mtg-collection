The gif is not the best due to it having its original size reduded to comply with GitHub's 10mb file size limit. For a more in-depth demo of the app, check [this recording](https://www.loom.com/share/f73c1c11ef4a48e39cb3f4618f9ecca9).

The goal of this project is to create an application that will help me keep my Magic: The Gathering collection updated. By doing that, I'll not only practice skills I already own, but, more importantly, I'll keep learning more about both front and back-end development. 

So far, I've developed a simple RESTful back-end on Spring Boot in which I have the CRUD operations in place. Recently, I'm putting effort on making the front-end better. It's built with React and I've been refactoring it to put to use knowledge I've acquired recently on the 12-month full-stack development course I'm taking. 

Feedback is welcome. ;)
